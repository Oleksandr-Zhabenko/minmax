# Revision history for minmax

## 0.1.0.0 -- 2024-01-13

* First version. Released on an unsuspecting world. Is a fork of the https://hackage.haskell.org/package/subG-0.6.1.0 package as well as also monoid-insertleft package is.

## 0.1.1.0 -- 2024-01-15

* First version revised A. Switched to foldl' instead of foldr in the functions here. It looks like for many cases it leads to more efficient imlementation both in time and space.
